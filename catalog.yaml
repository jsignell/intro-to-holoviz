    description: "This dataset is a cleaned composite of citizen science bird observations as described by La Sorte and Fink (2017). The eBird Citizen Science Project is a real-time, on line checklist program launched in 2002 by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the National Audubon Society. The observations of each volunteer participant join those of others creating a database of international avian observation events. The dataset contains count data for bird species observed by novice and experienced bird observers alike. Aggregated observation data is available for non-commercial research purposes. eBird data can be used to document the presence or absence of avian species, as well as abundance and distribution at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The dataset includes spatial, and temporal parameters describing the observation event. The data collection is static, updated annually. La Sorte FA, and Fink D.
